# GameTetris
<br>Only 2.9KB code. Based on 8-bit MCU (AT89C52/51) &amp;amp; 8 x 16 LED Matrix. Code migration to 16/32-bit MCUs or other LED matrix size only need to modify a few micro definition.<br>
<br>The .dsn is created by Proteus(V8.4), through which you can play the game by simulation.<br>
<br>The schematic is not a strict design, only shows the logics. For a real LED matrix, one has to consider drive/sink current ability of GPIOs and add some components â€” at least in serial some resistors to the matrix driving lines.<br>
