# myTetris
Only 2.9KB code. Based on 8-bit MCU (AT89C52/51) &amp; 8 x 16 LED Matrix.Code migration to 16/32-bit MCUs or other LED matrix size only need to modify a few micro definition.<br>
You can change ROW/COL value to suit your LED matrix size:<br>
```sh
#define ROW 16
#define COL 8
```
You can change MCUBITS value based on the MCU you use:<br>
``#define MCUBITS 8``
Of course, following ports related to LED matrix may also need to modify if you enlarge the matrix size:<br>
```sh
#define PORT_SEG0 P2
#define PORT_SEG1 P1
#define PORT_SCAN P0
#define PORT_KEYS P3
```
Or all you need is just to rewrite a LED matrix driver. <br>
<br>.DSN is the schematic, you can opne it by Proteus(V8.4) and play the game by simulation. However, the schematic is not a strict design since it only shows the electronic net logics. In real life, one has to
consider the driver/sink current of the GPIOs, add more components â€” or at least in serial with some resistors for the matrix
driving lines.<br>
<br>Have fun!<br>
